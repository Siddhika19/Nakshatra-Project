<p style="font-size:22px; color:white">lf you think you are beaten, you are.<br>
lf you think you dare not, you don't.<br>
lf you like to win but think you can't,<br>
lt's almost a cinch you won't.<br>
lf you think you'll lose, you're lost.<br>
For out in the world we find<br>
Success begins with a fellow's will.<br>
lt's all in the state of mind.<br>
lf you think you are out classed, you are.<br>
You've got to think high to rise.<br>
You've got to be sure of your-self before<br>
You can ever win the prize.<br>
Life's battles don't always go<br>
To the stronger or faster man.<br>
But sooner or later the man who wins<br>
ls the man who thinks he can.<br>
